# There exist many maze generation algorithms but I tend to prefer the one I've been using
# for several years but whose origin is unknown to me. I've added the code in the cited
# wikipedia entry. Feel free to complete it if you know the original author. This algorithm
# works by creating n (density) islands of length p (complexity). An island is created by
# choosing a random starting point with odd coordinates, then a random direction is chosen.
# If the cell two steps in a given direction is free, then a wall is added at both one step
# and two steps in this direction. The process is iterated for n steps for this island.
# p islands are created. n and p are expressed as float to adapt them to the size of the
# maze. With a low complexity, islands are very small and the maze is easy to solve. With
# low density, the maze has more "big empty rooms".
